    <h1>Sales Porportion Analysis</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why We Performed the Analysis</h2>
        <p>The sponsor expressed strong interest in exploring the relationship between sales meetings, trade shows, and sales outcomes. 
            Consequently, leveraging available data, we conducted an analysis to investigate potential correlations between the number 
            of purchasers and the number of events attended by Crystal D from 2018 to 2021.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How We Performed the Analysis</h2>
        <p>We conducted a correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, and significance testing on two key variables: the proportion 
            of sales and event frequency. To increase the accuracy of the analysis, we examined data over 48 months, covering the 4-year 
            period. The dependent variable, the proportion of sales, was manually calculated by dividing the number of purchasing accounts 
            in each month by the total number of accounts. The independent variable, event frequency, represents the number of events attended 
            by Crystal D each month. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The sales proportion has been fluctuating across 2018-2021, with a significant drop in April 2020. Generally, the sales proportion rate 
            was decreasing. The event frequency distribution indicates that Crystal D's event attendence mostly happened during summer and fall (chart 1). 
        </p>
        <p>From the correlation analysis, we found the correlation coefficient between sales proportion and event number is 0.20246001902272598. 
            Correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the number of events and the proportion 
            of sales. A correlation coefficient of 0.2-0.3 shows a weak linear relationship between two variables.
        </p>
        <p>From the linear regression analysis, we found the regression coefficient is 8.76 × 10^-5 and the intercept is 0.0043. It indicates that for 
            each additional event Crystal D attended, the proportion of sales increases by 8.76 × 10^-5. The intercept means that when there are no 
            events, the proportion of sales is expected to be approximately 0.00434. 
        </p>
        <p>From the significance test, the p-value is 0.168, which is greater than the commonly used threshold of 0.05 for significance. This means that 
            the test failed to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting there is no significant linear relationship between sales proportion and event numbers.

            <ul>
                <li>Sales proportion was decreasing during 2018-2021</li>
                <li>There is no linear relationship between the number of events and the proportion of sales</li>
                <li>However, we only collected data from attended events. Other events such as sales meetings or 
                    sales over phone calls were not included
